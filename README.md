# Algorithms in Functional JavaScript

For the Functional layman (:neckbeard:).

## Why?

- :star: This is for those who want to familiarize and learn all renowned Computer Science algorithms, including Merge-Sort, and the searches.
- :page_with_curl: This *also* includes famous coding questions that I've run in to during the de-facto **Karat Coding interview**, altered as to avoid copyright.

## What to Expect

These algorithms are good for you because they will teach you a couple things:
- Using Recursion
- Writing **good code**, or in other words, minimally dependent, robust, and reusable code.
- Using recent ECMAScript concepts, and *more importantly* language-agnostic concepts.
- Doing things **Functionally** (using the Functional-Programming Paradigm) when we can, and still being realistic by interacting with both Objects and Classes (interviewers will still expect you to know how to code O-O). 

### How

- Done using command-line NodeJS runtime environment. Download this to run.


```
node <filename>.js
```
