# Algorithms in Functional JavaScript



## Why?

- :whale: This is for those who want to familiarize and learn renowned Computer Science algorithms, including Merge-Sort, and the searches.
- :page_with_curl: This *also* includes some famous coding questions, and ones that I've run in to during the de-facto **Karat Coding interview**, altered as to avoid copyright.

## What to Expect

These written algorithms are good for you. They will teach you a couple of things:
- Using Recursion
- Writing **good code**, or in other words, code that is minimally dependent, robust, and reusable. We hate writing code for its sake.
- Using recent ECMAScript standards and styles, and *more importantly* language-agnostic concepts.
- Doing things **Functionally** (using the Functional-Programming Paradigm) when we can, and still being realistic by interacting with both Objects and Classes (interviewers will still expect you to know how to code Object-Oriented). 


## Glossary

- Technical Interview questions:

[Majong 'tiles' variant](./src_algorithmsjs/majongwinhand_solut_fp.js)

- Sorts and Searches:

[Merge Sort](./src_algorithmsjs/mergesort_solut_fp.js)  

[Quick-Sort](./src_algorithmsjs/quicksort_solut_fp.js)  

[Binary Search](./src_algorithmsjs/binarysearch_solut_fp.js)  

[Depth-first Search](./src_algorithmsjs/depthfirst_solut_fp.js)  

[Breadth-first Search](./src_algorithmsjs/breadthfirst_solut_fp.js)  

## Get Started

- Done using command-line NodeJS runtime environment. Download NodeJS. To run:

```
node <filename>.js
```

- Here are the included coding problems and questions that come with a walkthrough, along with comparable lines of code *you would expect* from mainstream websites that are more lines of code, and slower performance. Links of websites included:
